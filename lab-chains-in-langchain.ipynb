This ensures that the genetic information is passed on to the next generation of cells. \\n\\nAdditionally, DNA is constantly being used by cells to carry out processes such as protein synthesis, cell division, and repair. Having DNA in every cell allows for the coordination of these processes and ensures that the organism functions properly as a whole. \\n\\nIn summary, every cell in our body contains DNA because it is essential for the proper functioning and development of all living organisms.'"
